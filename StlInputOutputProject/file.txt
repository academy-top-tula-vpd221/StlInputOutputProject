Extracts characters from stream until end of line or the specified delimiter delim.

The first overload is equivalent to getline(s, count, widen('\n')).

Behaves as UnformattedInputFunction. After constructing and checking the sentry object, extracts characters from *this and stores them in successive locations of the array whose first element is pointed to by s, until any of the following occurs (tested in the order shown):

end of file condition occurs in the input sequence (in which case setstate(eofbit) is executed)
the next available character c is the delimiter, as determined by Traits::eq(c, delim). The delimiter is extracted (unlike basic_istream::get()) and counted towards gcount(), but is not stored.
count-1 characters have been extracted (in which case setstate(failbit) is executed).
If the function extracts no characters (e.g. if count < 1), setstate(failbit) is executed.

In any case, if count > 0, it then stores a null character CharT() into the next successive location of the array and updates gcount().
